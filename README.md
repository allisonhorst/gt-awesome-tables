# 'gt' for nice tables in R!

The package description, excellent examples, etc.: 
<https://github.com/rstudio/gt>

# The installation:

Install the development version of the 'gt' package (see below - not yet on CRAN). Note: I had to update a number of packages (prompted during gt install). 

    install.packages("devtools")
    remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
    
# The summary (from RStudio):

"With the gt package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. The gt philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts."

See the link above for a description of various components for a gt table. 

# Some little examples:

Since sometimes I'm even overwhelmed by the "simple" examples in R-documentation, I created some of my own here (using built-in datasets or tibbles that I make). Each example shows something a little different, described in the .Rmd. Or just see the html, it's all there.
