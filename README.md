The package description, excellent examples, etc.: 
<https://github.com/rstudio/gt>

# The installation:

Install the development version of the 'gt' package (see below - not yet on CRAN). Note: I had to update a number of packages (prompted during gt install). 

    install.packages("devtools")
    remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
    
# The summary (from RStudio):

"With the gt package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. The gt philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts."

See the link above for a description of various components for a gt table. 

# Some little examples
